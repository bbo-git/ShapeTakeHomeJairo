### remarks:
 A lot of time was spend finding the right library to load .glb files, and also saving the file using a download task took some effort (it seemed like a trivial task...). I focussed on a clean bugfree solution that works in dark mode as well as light mode (only tested in dark mode ;) I would have loved to take on the advanced challenge but lost too much time trying to get MoltenVK working... haha...
